Recon-X is the ultimate tool to conveniently carry out the reconnaissance of your target and discover its attacking surface. The tool itself comes with two options for installation. First is the API mode, that is based on hackertarget API making it light and efficient and can be used for the identification of potential vulnerabilities. However, the API is the free one so the scans are limited to 100 calls per day per IP. So either you can use proxy to change your public IP after API counter exceedes, or you can go with the <b>second mode</b> of this tool, which uses the best OSINT tools available on github, making this a beast for doing reconnaissance.
